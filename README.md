# ML_Project
Medical Image Classification Using Deep Learning Techniques.

This project implements transfer learning and deep learning models like LeNet-5, DenseNet121, and EfficientNetB0 to classify medical images across the three datasets: Brain Tumor Classification, Skin Cancer HAM10000, and Chest X-ray COVID/Pneumonia.
Link for the three datasets :- 
1) Brain Tumor Classification Dataset :- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sartajbhuvaji/brain-tumor-classification-mri
2) Chest X-ray COVID/Pneumonia Dataset (CoronaHack) :- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prashant268/chest-xray-covid19-pneumonia
3) Skin Cancer HAM10000 Dataset :- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kmader/skin-cancer-mnist-ham10000

We have completed all code development and model training in Google Colab.
Thus, all necessary libraries like TensorFlow, Keras, Matplotlib, Seaborn were pre-installed and no additional setup was required.
So, If you have plan to run this project in other environments like Jupyter Notebook or VS Code or PyCharm you need to ensure that you have installed the different libraries such as Tensorflow, numpy, pandas, seaborn, scikit-learn, matplotlib in your software.
